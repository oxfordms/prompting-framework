üìå MEMORY BLOCK #1: CHRIS CALDWELL ‚Äì MASTER PROFILE

Chris Caldwell is the Managing Director of Leasing at TSCG, responsible for overseeing Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky, and the Florida Panhandle (excluding Tallahassee). He manages five offices in Nashville, Memphis, Louisville, Huntsville, and Birmingham, and focuses on retail leasing strategy, asset value optimization, team leadership, and business development. 

Workflows & Systems:
- Uses Cloze CRM with tailored ‚ÄúNext Step‚Äù flows, contact history tracking, and territory-based follow-ups. Client and owner outreach is strategic and structured.
- Relies on separate projects to manage high-detail workflows: ‚ÄúListing Agreement Review,‚Äù ‚ÄúCRE Summaries,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDaily Briefing.‚Äù These house redline rules, article formatting, and news structure.
- In all contract analysis, references to articles, sections, and subsections must be precise and legally traceable. These rules are documented in the Listing Agreement Review project.

Finance & Income Tracking:
- Uses Monarch Money for tracking fixed salary, override deposits, reimbursements, break-even goals, and estimated quarterly taxes.
- Also uses a custom Google Sheet for high-level strategy, categorized income vs. variable overrides.
- Tracks pending check deposits with $0 manual entries in Monarch, storing actual details in the notes field until reconciled.

Fitness & Nutrition:
- Trains 3x/week using a full-body routine based on Drew Baye and Ted Naiman‚Äôs protocols: time-under-tension, progressive overload, short duration.
- Equipment includes adjustable dumbbells (5‚Äì55 lbs), pull-up bar, bench, rower, mats. Accommodates a slightly weaker right shoulder (mostly recovered from frozen shoulder).
- Nutrition strategy prioritizes satiety, protein leverage, and P:E ratio analysis. Minimal calorie tracking; focuses on nutrient density.

Style & Preferences:
- Prefers structured, concise responses with optional dry wit and zero fluff.
- Uses ‚òê checkboxes for follow-ups, not bullet points or dashes.
- Avoids ‚Äúwoke‚Äù tone. Never uses ‚Äúanytime‚Äù (always ‚Äúany time‚Äù).
- Drafts should exclude quotation marks for easy copying.
- Cross-platform comparisons (ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini) should be integrated when summarizing articles or research findings.

Chris is a technique-driven home cook with professional-level equipment: two sous vide machines, Vitamix, Instant Pot, KitchenAid mixer with pasta roller and cutter, Tovala oven, air fryer, immersion blender, and sharpening tools for a complete knife set. Pantry is well-stocked with MSG, Jane‚Äôs Krazy Mixed-Up Salt, Better Than Bouillon, oils, vinegars (including Moscatel), citrus, garlic, onions, and fresh vegetables.

Cooking Preferences & Style:
- Prefers bold, layered flavors‚Äîespecially Latin, Tex-Mex, Italian, and Mediterranean profiles.
- Avoids fennel and pesto entirely.
- Follows a protein-leverage and satiety-first approach to meal planning. Calorie tracking is minimal.
- Considers soup a culinary benchmark. Enjoys making homemade stock when time allows.
- On first attempts, he closely follows the original recipe with light seasoning tweaks. More aggressive modifications are made after evaluating results.

Special Notes:
- Royal Red shrimp are a favorite. Saut√©ed for 2‚Äì3 minutes or boiled only until water returns to a boil. Prefers minimal sauces and quick-cooking techniques to preserve flavor.
- Vinegar preferences depend on dish: red wine vinegar for bolder applications, Moscatel for sweeter balance in vinaigrettes.
